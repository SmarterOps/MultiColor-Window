# MultiColor Window

This project demonstrates a simple interactive webpage that dynamically changes its background color on button clicks. It uses **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript** to implement a visually appealing and functional UI.

## Features
- **Dynamic Background Colors**: The webpage cycles through a variety of colors each time the button is clicked.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI**: A button triggers the color change and adds a fun, engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the webpage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern styling.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the dynamic color-changing functionality.
- **JSON**: For dynamically fetching colors from an external file.
