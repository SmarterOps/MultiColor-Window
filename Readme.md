- **Responsive Design**: Styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI**: A button triggers the color change and adds a fun, engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the webpage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern styling.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the dynamic color-changing functionality.
